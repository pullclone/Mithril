### ‚öñÔ∏è Purpose

Mithril is a tool of protection, not obfuscation. It was built to honor the right to private thought, personal sovereignty, and peaceful autonomy ‚Äî not to aid deception, criminality, or harm.

This charter is not legally binding, but by using Mithril, you are agreeing in good faith to uphold the ethical intent of the tool.

### üîê Core Principles

#### 1\. **Privacy Is Not Suspicion**

You have a right to protect your personal life from intrusion, even if you have nothing to hide. Mithril exists to make that protection seamless, accessible, and dignified.

#### 2\. **Plausible Deniability Is Not a License for Deceit**

Mithril supports advanced encryption strategies for the following ethical purposes:

- Space where a safe haven of thought can exist
- Medical and legal confidentiality
- Separation of professional / personal data where there is a duty
- Safeguard against the violations of individual rights

**Mithril is not to be used to conceal harm to others.**

#### 3\. **Powerful Tools Require Personal Responsibility**

> _You are the steward of your encrypted volumes. Use them not to hide from justice, but to remain free from injustice._

### 4\. **Encrypted Does Not Mean Invisible**

Mithril does not erase your digital fingerprint. It empowers you to protect your data ‚Äî not eliminate the consequences of your actions.

Lawful investigations, forensic tools, and behavioral intelligence will still recognize malevolence when it exists. Mithril simply ensures that _compassion is not mistaken for guilt, and victimhood is not punished as concealment_.

## ü§ù In Practice

By using Mithril, you agree that:

- You will not use this software in an attempt to cover up or enable abuse.
- You will hold the digital rights of others to be equally self-evident and unalienable to your own.
- You accept the duty of care that comes with protecting sensitive information.
- You understand that privacy is not absolute immunity ‚Äî but it is the civil obligation of any free citizen.

## üå± Final Word

**This is a tool for healers, not for hate.**

If you are protecting your fellow-man, a moral conviction, your own person, or honoring the sacrifices of your countrymen, freely given to enable the posterity on which you now stand ‚Äî this tool is yours.

If you seek to hide or enable harm, silence truth, or mask wrongdoing ‚Äî you will not find the shelter you're looking for under Mithril's protection.

We believe that everyone deserves the dignity and protection that Mithril was forged for. Do not squander it or you will lose that right.
